<h1>How I became a model</h1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an ordinary girl with some complexes, and sometimes self-doubt. I had never had a shoot with a professional photographer before my friend  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lanatimkovskayaphotography/"> <u>Lana Timkovskaya</u></a> who is a great photographer asked me, one year ago, to pose for her photography school project. I was excited to have such wonderful opportunity! That shoot was in a studio, I had a couple of different outfits, and I was so stressed out. But after some time, I realized that I like to pose and laugh in front of the camera. After receiving the pictures from Lana, I was so impressed with the result. Her work was amazing. I posted one of the pictures on my FB page, and I received many positive feedbacks on it. My friend Marina Sobchinska asked me if that was a photo session for some Fashion Magazine. Of course, it wasn’t, but that question inspired me. I also remember how my another friend Marina Gluzman told me that I should try to be a model. I really appreciate everybody who supported me that time and now! You guys are amazing! <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, I don’t have a model appearance, and back to Ukraine, I wouldn’t even think about modeling. But here in the USA in the country with so many opportunities for everybody I was thinking about “What if I can try to become a model?” From that day I started to explore this field in Seattle. I didn’t find a lot of information about this topic on the web, but I kept searching. I found some Model Calls on Craigslist, and I sent many emails to ask to consider me as a model. I didn’t have a portfolio back then; I had just a couple of pictures from my very talented friend Lana. Therefore, nobody answered my emails. I almost gave up, but one day I found couple of Facebook networking groups where you could find a photographer and hair/make up artists for TFP (Trade for Print). That is when you collaborate with many talented people who sometimes don’t have much experience. I was that person because I didn’t have an experience in modeling. I tried to be a model just once, and that was for my friend. I sent tons of messages literally, and after some time people started to answer me and ask me to collaborate with them. The first photographer who answered was Anne Snider of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SkyePhoenixPhotography/"> <u>Skye Phoenix Photography</u></a>. We went to spectacular location near the Rainier. It was gorgeous out there. There was a lot of snow, but even though I was so cold I was very happy! Thank you, Anne, I appreciate that you took me to my first outside photoshoot. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that time, and this is almost one year, I have worked with more than 100 photographers, we did so many interesting and beautiful <a href="pages/modeling/photoshoots.html"> <u>photoshoots</u></a>. I also did runways for amazing local designers to support Fashion Industry in Seattle area. Also, I worked with many creative hair and makeup artists. I was <a href="pages/modeling/published-work.html"> <u>published</u></a> a handful of times in fashion magazines. I am really happy with this achievement in my life. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I spent a lot of time to aim this result. I went to different networking events in Seattle. I spent hours chatting with people online. It's not an easy job to arrange the single shoot. You should find an outfit which your photographer will love, then you should set up the location, and finally, you should find HMUA to look good on your pictures. You should have strong communication and organizational skills. Because always you will work with new people. Some photographer told me that she doesn’t work more than two times with one model. But this is not the rule for everybody. Many times I collaborated with the same people, and we were satisfied with the result of our work. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when I had three shoots in a single day, that was crazy, but I enjoyed it! I had shoots almost every day. I always had my calendar open in front of me. Sometimes I just didn’t have time to another shoot, and I had to cancel it. All people with whom I worked were just amazing. Everybody was respectful, patient and kind to me. I appreciate this, guys! It was a pleasure to work with everyone. I hope we will work together again. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had many shoots I can't even say how many and just three photographers didn't send me pictures back. I think they were very busy and I hope I will receive my pictures back someday. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this year I learned a lot. I found inspiration in many my friends - models who were amazing and passionate about their job. By the way, I didn’t receive any money for my work that was always non-commercial shoots just for expanding our portfolios. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to say that everybody can start to do whatever she/he desires. Just give it a try and don’t give up until you see the result. And I believe that you will see it soon. Be positive :) Passionate, persistence and hard work can lead you to success in any of your endeavors! Good luck, my friend!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any question, please send me a message.  I would love to chat with you. Also you can see more my work on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marynayesakova/"> <u>Facebook page</u></a>. I hope you enjoyed reading my post. <br>
Cheers!
